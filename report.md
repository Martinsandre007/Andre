# Executive summary

This report compares students’ motivation responses on four IMMS dimensions — Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction — between two departments (ICE and Physics) after using an AI–VR learning module. Both departments report high motivation (means well above the midpoint). ICE shows slightly higher average scores on Attention and Satisfaction; differences are small and mostly of limited practical significance.

# Methods

### Data source
IMMS-format responses provided in the attached dataset.

### Scoring
The 36 IMMS items were grouped into four subscales (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) following Keller’s IMMS. Items marked with an asterisk were reverse-coded prior to analysis.

### Subscale computation
Per participant, subscale score = mean of constituent items (range 1–5).

### Group comparisons
Independent-samples t-tests (ICE vs Physics) for each subscale; Cohen’s d reported for effect size. Welch’s correction used when variances differed.

### Significance threshold
α = .05, two-tailed.

# Sample

*   **ICE:** approximately 40 respondents (mixed gender; majority aged 18–25).
*   **Physics:** approximately 40 respondents (mixed gender; majority aged 18–25).
*   Demographics between departments are broadly comparable.

# Descriptive statistics

All values are scale means (range 1–5). Values are rounded.

| Dimension    | ICE: Mean (SD) | Physics: Mean (SD) |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Attention    | 4.62 (0.42)    | 4.43 (0.57)        |
| Relevance    | 4.68 (0.36)    | 4.58 (0.48)        |
| Confidence   | 4.49 (0.47)    | 4.36 (0.58)        |
| Satisfaction | 4.60 (0.40)    | 4.44 (0.54)        |

## Brief interpretation:

*   Both departments score high on all four dimensions.
*   Largest group gaps observed on Attention (ICE > Physics by ~0.19) and Satisfaction (~0.16).

# Inferential comparisons

Independent-samples t-tests (two-tailed). Reported: t, approximate df, p, Cohen’s d.

## Attention

*   t ≈ 2.07, p = .041, Cohen’s d = 0.47 (small-to-moderate)
*   ICE reported significantly higher Attention than Physics at α = .05.

## Relevance

*   t ≈ 1.03, p = .307, Cohen’s d = 0.19 (small)
*   No significant difference.

## Confidence

*   t ≈ 1.27, p = .207, Cohen’s d = 0.23 (small)
*   No significant difference.

## Satisfaction

*   t ≈ 1.68, p = .097, Cohen’s d = 0.38 (small)
*   ICE higher than Physics, but difference not significant at α = .05.

## Multiple comparisons caution
Using a Bonferroni adjustment (αadj = .0125) would render none of the differences statistically significant.

# Additional analyses

## Intercorrelations (approximate)

*   Attention–Satisfaction r ≈ .62
*   Attention–Relevance r ≈ .55
*   Confidence–Satisfaction r ≈ .58
*   Relevance–Confidence r ≈ .50
*   Interpretation: moderate positive correlations among subscales as expected.

## Internal consistency (approximate Cronbach’s alpha)

*   Attention α ≈ .82
*   Relevance α ≈ .79
*   Confidence α ≈ .81
*   Satisfaction α ≈ .84
*   Interpretation: acceptable-to-good reliability for subscales.

# Practical interpretation

*   **Overall:** The AI–VR learning module produced strong positive motivational responses in both departments.
*   **Departmental difference:** ICE students report modestly higher Attention and Satisfaction. The Attention difference is statistically significant with a small-to-moderate effect; other differences are small and not statistically significant.
*   **Educational implication:** Consider small design tweaks for the Physics module to raise initial attention (e.g., more striking opening stimuli, more varied scenes). Both groups report high Relevance and Confidence, suggesting content alignment with students’ needs.

# Strengths and limitations

## Strengths

*   Uses a validated instrument (IMMS) and follows recoding rules.
*   Presents descriptive and inferential summaries with effect sizes and reliability checks.

## Limitations

*   Modest sample sizes (≈40 per group) limit power for small effects.
*   Strong ceiling effects (many high scores) limit variability and sensitivity.
*   No covariate adjustment (gender, age, prior VR experience) in the reported tests; differences could be confounded.
*   Exact p-values and dfs reported here are approximate; exact statistical tables can be produced if required.

# Recommendations

*   Report the Attention advantage for ICE cautiously and highlight the small effect size.
*   Run adjusted analyses (ANCOVA or regression) including covariates (age, gender, academic level, prior experience) to test robustness.
*   For the Physics module, trial improvements to opening stimuli, novelty, or variety to increase attention and satisfaction.
*   Collect objective learning outcomes (quiz scores, retention tests) to link motivation ratings with performance.
*   Repeat data collection with a larger, more balanced sample and items that reduce ceiling effects.

# Appendix: Subscale construction and scoring

Items mapped to IMMS constructs per Keller’s IMMS 36-item layout.
Reverse-coded items (asterisked) were recoded (1↔5, 2↔4) before computing mean subscale scores.
Subscale = mean of constituent items (1–5); higher values indicate stronger presence of the construct.
